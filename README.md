# Labor Market Analysis
This Python code utilizes the Selenium library for web scraping on the website https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/home, aiming to extract information about job offers. Initially, the environment is set up, the Chrome browser is opened, and access is granted to the job search page. Subsequently, search criteria such as job name (in this case, "trade") and location (Winnipeg, MB) are input. After performing the search, a process is implemented to load more results, as the page initially displays only a portion of available job opportunities. A loop is executed to click the "More Results" button and load all job listings.

Following that, details for each job, such as title, company, distance, location, posting date, salary, and the corresponding link, are collected. This information is structured into a dictionary for each job and added to a list named joblist. Finally, using the pandas library, a DataFrame is created from the joblist list, facilitating the analysis and manipulation of the gathered information. It is important to note that the code incorporates random pauses to simulate human behavior and avoid website restrictions.
